Of course any tools or utilities introduced to an enterprise environment requires some sort of single signon user managemnet.  Let's talk about how Terraform helps with this administration necessity.

name: User Management History
# Corprate Account Management
LDAP/Active Directory Since '90s
* Authentice Users on Workstations
* Authenticate for e-mail/CRM/Intranet
* Focused on on-prem application

Some may remember single sign on for corprate environments.  I logged into my Windows Workstation, which authenticated me against Active Directory.  That gave me access to email, and usually the Intranet.  This is great for on-prem authentication.  Sometimes I hated it, but it was nice not having different credentials for each internal service.

# So Many Passwords!

Today's Web-Based Landscape

Now we extend the LDAP and single sign-on functionality to distributed webapps.  Each of these services requires credentials, with complex passwords.  This is the reason why password managers exist!  Do we really want to add more utilitites with individual credential management?

The Security Assertion Markup Language has been around since the early 2000s, and facilitates single sign-on across web applications.  Terraform fully supports SAML 2.0 with attribute matching.  Any Identity Provider that supports SAML can perform authentication, and Attribute Matching provides Authorization

User Teams can be managed on an organization level, or at an individual workspace level.  Organizational level teams are focused more around infrastructure management and governance, while workspace is focused around contributions and creations.

SAML configuration is pretty simple, through the TFE administration interface.  This is also where you'll associate attributes with specific teams.

So HashiCorp has really worked to make adoption of Terraform as simple as possible...the User Management functions is just another example.
