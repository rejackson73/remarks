# CI/CD Pipelines with Terraform
## Azure DevOps

Terraform enables Infrastructure as Code for multiple public and private cloud environments.  Over the last several years, the concept of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery has proliferated about the Development community.  These practices and methodology are now extending to Infrastructure as Code and Immutable Infrastructure

name: Why CI/CD
# Why CI/CD Infrastructure
* Introduce smaller more frequent changes
* Automate testing as changes are made
* Deploy incremental updates to the system
* Tighter coordination with Development and Operations (DevOps)
Within programming, large, complex programs are broken out in to functions and reusable libraries.


???
So why bother with CI/CD.  This methodology allows us to create smaller and more frequent changes, allowing us to fail early, fail often, and easily identify the problem.

Integration with CI/CD largely depends on the amount of code you want to do, or the level of support the CI/CD product has for Terraform.  Azure Repos are fully supported by Terraform today, and the Webhook integration is in Beta.  Several operators have done manual integrations with CI/CD platforms, mostly Jenkins.
